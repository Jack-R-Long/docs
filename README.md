# What is Rownd?

Rownd is a user authentication and account platform that helps you convert more visitors to your website into actual (paying) customers.

We're focused on passwordless sign-in that uses email and SMS as a means of distributing authentication links that allow users to verify their email/phone after they've had the opportunity to explore your product or service.

Many website visitors get close to trying out your product, but are deterred by a sign up or registration process that asks for too much information (e.g., name, email address, password, etc).

While social login (e.g., Google or Facebook) is often seen as a solution to this problem, it can also be a deterrent to visitors that might not want their profile information transmitted to you before they trust your company.

Rownd helps you build lasting relationships with your users without extra work on your part.
