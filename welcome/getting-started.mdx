## 2. Add your team.
Getting users to sign-up and staying engaged is a cross-domain task.  [Add your teammates](/administration/teams): developers, product manager, security specialist, and growth teams.  As you add Rownd to more sites, adding automations and sub-brands will become more important. 

## 3. Get your app key
[Create](/configuration/app-credentials) and grab your app key and secret. 

## 4. Install Rownd
