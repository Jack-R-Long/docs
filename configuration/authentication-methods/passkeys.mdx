## Introduction to passkeys

Passkeys offer a secure and convenient method for users to sign in to their accounts on your website and mobile apps. By enabling passkeys, users with passkey-enabled devices can save their passkeys to their account. Once a passkey is saved, users can quickly sign in using their passkeys, providing a seamless and efficient experience.

## Navigate to Authentication Methods
Open your app in the [Rownd platform](https://app.rownd.io/applications). Then click on the **Sign-in methods** tab on the left to adjust your flow.

  <Info>
    At this time, passkey cannot be the only form of sign-in enabled. Users can add passkeys after signing up with another method. After the first sign-in, they can use their passkeys to sign in to their account. This ensures account access across different devices.
