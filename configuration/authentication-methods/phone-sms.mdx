#### When to use phone sign-in

There are few more powerful ways to bridge the computer-to-mobile gap than with SMS sign-in. Rownd utilizes powerful sign-up links that make it easy to verify a phone number without having to copy down annoying 4-8 digit passcodes.

When paired with Rownd's mobile download links, users can leverage SMS to download and sign-in to your mobile app in just a few taps.

#### Enabling SMS authentication

1. Navigate to **Sign-in methods** in the [Rownd dashboard](https://app.rownd.io).
2. Toggle the switch for **Phone number** to the "on" position.
3. Click **Save**.

<Info>
There is an incremental cost to send SMS text messages. Most Rownd plans include a set number of messages per-month and a small surcharge for each message thereafter. Surcharges may vary based on the destination country / carrier.
