Rownd email sign-in is one of the easiest ways to add authentication to a website or app. In fact, it's enabled by default! Instead of having users create an insecure or hard-to-remember password, they simply enter their email address and verify it by clicking a button in a branded email sent by Rownd. 

#### Enabling email authentication

1. Navigate to **Sign-in methods** in the [Rownd dashboard](https://app.rownd.io).
2. Toggle the switch for **Email** to the "on" position.
3. Click **Save**.

#### Customizing email messages

Rownd allows you to change portions of the email to better match your brand. See our [email customization article](/configuration/customizations/email-customization) for more information.
