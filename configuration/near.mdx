## Introduction to NEAR and Rownd's wallet experience

NEAR Protocol is a scalable and user-friendly blockchain platform designed to power the next generation of decentralized applications. With its focus on simplifying the developer and user experience, NEAR is poised to drive mass adoption of web3 technologies. 

Rownd's integration with NEAR addresses one of the most significant barriers to entry for new web3 users - the onboarding process. By automating wallet generation, securely storing private keys, and enabling seamless wallet management through the Rownd profile, users can easily interact with NEAR-based applications. This streamlined approach accelerates user onboarding, reduces friction, and fosters a more inclusive web3 ecosystem, empowering a wider audience to participate in the decentralized revolution.

 The integration offers the following features:

### 1. Automatic wallet creation

When the integration is properly configured, Rownd will automatically create a NEAR wallet for each user. This eliminates the need for users to manually create a wallet, streamlining the onboarding process and making it more user-friendly.

### 2. Secure private key storage

Rownd securely stores the private key associated with each user's NEAR wallet using double encryption. This ensures that the private key remains safe from unauthorized access, providing a high level of security for users' assets.

### 3. User wallet access

Users can view their NEAR wallet balance and transaction history through the Rownd profile. This provides a convenient way for users to keep track of their wallet without needing to use a separate interface.

### 4. Named wallet creation

With Rownd, users have the option to create a named wallet for their NEAR account. This makes it easy for users to remember their wallet addresses and share them with others for transactions.

Users can easily attach a NEAR wallet to their Rownd account, making it simple to manage their blockchain assets alongside their other authentication methods.

### 6. NEAR wallet names retrieval

Developers can retrieve the names of users' NEAR wallets through user-data queries. This allows for seamless integration with your application, enabling users to interact with their wallets directly within your app.
