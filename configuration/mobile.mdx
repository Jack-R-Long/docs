Rownd makes it simple to add authentication to your mobile apps built natively or using multiplatform frameworks like React Native and Flutter.

Using Rownd, you can enable a golden path for mobile app download and user conversion. Instead of losing context when a user downloads your app, Rownd seamlessly guides them through registration, app install, and automagic authentication. The user profile data is already present so you can immediately start personalizing the user experience.

<Info>
A [Rownd Mobile SDK](/sdk-reference/mobile) must be installed in your app to use this feature.

### Configuration

To enable mobile app authentication, you must first configure your mobile app details in the Rownd dashboard.

1. Select **Sign-in methods** from the left navigation menu.
2. In the Sign-in preferences section, locate **Mobile app sign-in**
3. Press **Enable**.

If this is your first time configuring mobile app sign-in, you will be prompted to provide some details about your app.

#### Set mobile subdomain

Rownd provides a customizable, unique subdomain for each mobile-enabled app. This subdomain is used to steer users to the correct app when they click on a link in an email or SMS message. If your app is already installed on the user's device, the subdomain will cause the app to open automatically when users click on the link.

1. Enter a subdomain name in the **Subdomain** field. (e.g., `myapp` for `myapp.rownd.link` - the `.rownd.link` portion is added automatically).

#### Provide app details

Configuration information is needed for your app on a per-platform basis. Press the toggle next to the platforms your app supports (e.g., iOS and Android).

For each platform, provide the requested information in the available fields.

##### iOS apps

- App store URL - The direct link to your app in the Apple App Store
- Bundle IDs - A comma-separated list of bundle IDs for your app (e.g., `com.example.myapp`)
- Team ID - The team ID for your app as shown in the Apple Developer Portal (e.g., `1234567890`)

##### Android apps

- Play store URL - The direct link to your app in the Google Play Store
- Package name - The package name for your app as shown in the Google Play Console (e.g., `com.example.myapp`)
- SHA256 certificate fingerprints - For dev/test apps signed locally or manually, obtain the SHA256 hash from your keystore. For apps distributed through the Google Play Store that use automatic signing, obtain the SHA256 hash from the Google Play Console.
