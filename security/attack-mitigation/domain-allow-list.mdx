## Introduction to allowed domains

Domain allow-listing is a security feature in Rownd that provides an additional layer of protection for your application. By specifying a list of approved domains, you can ensure that Rownd only authenticates users from the designated websites. This helps prevent unauthorized access attempts and keeps your user data secure. By using domain allow-listing in Rownd, you can take greater control over your app's security, giving you and your users peace of mind.

## Navigate to Domain Allow-listing

Open your app in the [Rownd platform](https://app.rownd.io/applications). Ensure you are on the HOME section and settings on the right side of the screen.
