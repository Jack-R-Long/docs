### How it works

Rownd advocates for a multi-layered approach to combat abuse, using various signals to detect and prevent attacks. We deliver this automatically for all customers. There's no need to pay extra for peace of mind.

| Feature | Attack signal | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Bot Detection](/security/attack-mitigation/bot-detection) | Failure to invisibly detect a legitimate human actor. | Uses multiple signals and invisible cryptographic challenges from end-user clients to determine whether they are legitimate. |
| [Suspicious IP Throttling](/security/attack-mitigation/suspicious-ip-throttling) | Rate of sign in attempts from a client. | Automatically throttles clients that try to sign up or sign in too quickly. Also automatically de-duplicates emails and text messages from similar sign-in attempts to reduce costs. |
| Brute Force Protection | N/A | Passwordless means reduced risk brute-force attacks. |
| Breached Password Detection | N/A | Passwordless means no breached passwords. |

### Why passwordless matters

Rownd is 100% passwordless.  Most users re-use passwords.  You can set complex password rules and encourage the use of unique passwords, but a vast majority ignore those recommendations.  Passwordless user-expereicnes are better and more secure.  Apps and companies that use passwords as a primary factor of authentication should strongly reconsider as they are putting themselves and their customers at risk.
