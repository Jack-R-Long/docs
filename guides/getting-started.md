# ðŸš€ Getting started

Deploying Rownd should be a relatively straightforward process. It typically involves a few steps:

* Access the Rownd dashboard
* Select the initial user profile fields
* Deploy the Rownd snippet to static websites
* (optional) Add the Rownd SDK to front-end and back end servers

By deploying Rownd to your main website, blog, docs, etc, you can begin onboarding users even before having an app. For example, if you're creating a waitlist for your product, Rownd can manage the sign-up process. You can even leverage Rownd to gradually on-ramp users to your app once it's ready for beta testers.
