title: "The Rownd Hub and User profiles"
---

The Rownd Hub is an integrated sign-in and profile widget for Rownd. It allows users to easily sign in and access their profile information instantly.

### The Rownd hub 

The Rownd hub will appear upon installation in the bottom left corner of your desktop app or website. It will not appear initally on your mobile app. The hub displays a black outline user icon if a user has not yet signed in and a filled user icon if they have. From the hub users can sign in and view their profile informaiton by clicking on the top user icon. When signed in they can view and manage profile data by clicking "Full account controls." 

Whatever styles you have set in the "Design" tab will carry through in the style of the hub and profile. If you wish to remove the hub, contact us at support@rownd.io.

#### User profiles 

With the Rownd Hub or the "Launch profile" automation, your users can access their account data, including connected emails, phone numbers, social accounts, and other personal information, in the Rownd profile.

Utilizing the Rownd profile for your users offers several benefits:

- **Data privacy**: Users have complete control over their data through the profile. They can edit, remove, and add profile data without requiring any development efforts on your part.
- **Data security and management**: Storing user data in Rownd reduces the risk of breaches and hacks. You can manage user data from a single location in the Rownd platform.
- **Improved user support**: As the profile expands, users gain additional capabilities, such as opting in to marketing communications, connecting new sign-in methods, deleting their accounts (if needed), defining their preferences, and more. These functions can be performed without the need for extra development work on your platform or manual intervention.
